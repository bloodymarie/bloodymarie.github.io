title: Blog about menstrual cycle tracking  
---

## [](#header-2)This is all about tracking menstrual cycles, fertilities and sexualities.

There are so many people who track their menstrual cycles, their fertilities and their sexualities with excitement. Others do it because their doctors told them to do so. Others do it for other reasons.

**There is no right or wrong when it comes to tracking your menstrual cycles. As long as it feels good to you.**

## [](#header-2)However there is somehow something missing...

A customizbale period tracking app, that is open source and somehow also easy to use.

## [](#header-2)So here's the plan

For the next four weeks I will be in Lima as a part of [HackerParadise](http://www.hackerparadise.org/), and I will work on an open source period tracking app. The experiences of menstrual cycles may vary due to age, emotional and physical well-being, but also political and social circumstances. This is why I will collect ideas of users and try to implement requested features that take into account a broader approach towards the experience of menstrual cycles. Adding a comment option for each day will be one of the features. I will also focus on writing a beginner friendly documentation so that users are invited to customize the app and use it as a personal coding project.

This is also meant to be a coding project for newbies

who would want to dive into the world of code-it-yourself!

Einmal habe ich mit einer Journalistin über Menstruation telefoniert und sie hat sich [dazu Notizen gemacht](http://www.spiegel.de/netzwelt/apps/menstruations-apps-clue-cycles-co-in-der-regel-nuetzlich-a-1093652.html).
