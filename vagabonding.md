## Vagabonding

Connecting, giving a talk, feeling excited and awkward, much much social pressure, much much jumping into the unknown. Whatever it may feel like, I highly recommend going out, presenting a topic that you care about, spreading the word and engaging in discussions. May it be awkward, may it be really bad sometimes. In the end it all leads to you gaining more knowledge about it, sharpening your opinion and getting to know lots of interesting people. Apply for conferences or meet-ups, write papers and publish them on blogs or even start your own blog.
