## For the love of Code

So because I am on my way to become a verrry serious and probably a verry good & real software engineer, I am tempted to play around with code in order to create my own period tracking app. It puts you in a situation where you have to be clear about your expectations towards such an app. What needs to be in it, what would be nice to have? What is missing so far? And how are you going to take all these ideas and translate them into code? So many questions...

## 99 problems & failing shouldn't be one

Some people have trouble seeing themselves as coders because they have never done it before or they were bad at maths or because of other reasons.
Key is, however, having lots of patience with yourself, extra time and much love for coding (love can grow if you take good care of it). You got all this? Or wanna give it a try anyway? Welcome on bored! <3

Hello World!
```
So I will start with an Android app, because *firstly* there are way more people using Android over iOS and because *secondly* Android got more love for free and open source software. Check [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/) out, which is an alternate Google Play Store that you can use with an Android phone and lists applications that are based on free and open source software. Did I already mention, that I am a huge fan of free & open source software? Well, I am & here you go.

## Playing with Android

Until you wait to see the first lines of code of my project, why don't you try playing around with Android apps yourself? There is an Android online tutorial for newbies. I think it could be a bigger challenge for the ones who never looked at code before, so don't worry if it may take you longer to understand each chapter.

You can also look at this online tutorial, anything that helps you is a good fit I guess...

## Coding communities & initiatives

If you have no previous coding knowledge and would want to give it a try, these initiatives are **highly recommended**. They are not specifically meant for learning Android, though. But it is also a nice & good way to meet like-minded people and it was how I discovered my love for code and technologies!
*   [Rails Girls Communities](http://railsgirls.com) all over the world offering one day workshops of teaching Ruby on Rails for people who identify as female
*   [RoRganize](https://rorganize.it/) it to find other Rails Girls students, coaches and project groups for learning Ruby and Rails
*   [ClojureBridge](http://www.clojurebridge.org/) aims to increase diversity offering free, beginner-friendly Clojure programming workshops for underrepresented groups in tech
*   [OpenTechSchool](http://www.opentechschool.org/) is a distributed community initiative organising welcoming and inclusive code learning happenings
