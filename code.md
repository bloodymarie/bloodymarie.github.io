## For the love of Code

So because I am on my way to become a very serious and probably a very good & real software engineer, I am tempted to play around with code in order to create my own period tracking app. It puts you in a situation where you have to be clear about your expectations towards such an app. What needs to be in it, what would be nice to have? What is missing so far? And how are you going to take all these ideas and translate them to code? So many questions...

Key is, however, having lots of patience with yourself, extra time and much love for coding. You got all this? Or wanna give it a try anyway? Well, hello world, welcome on bored! <3

So I will start with an Android app, because there are more people using Android over iOS and because there is also [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/), which is an alternate Google Play Store and lists applications that are based on free and open source software. Did I already mention, that I am a huge fan of free & open source software? Well, here you go.

Hello World!

Until you wait to see first lines of code of my project, why don't you try playing around with Android apps yourself? There is an Android online tutorial for newbies. I think it could be a challenge for the ones who never looked at code before, so don't worry if it may take you longer to understand each chapter.

You can also look at this online tutorial, anything that helps you is a good fit I guess...
*   [Android Tutorial](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/android/) hosted by tutorialspoint

If you have no previous coding knowledge and would want to give it a try, these initiatives are **highly recommended**. It is also a good way to meet like-minded people. This was how I discovered my love for code and technologies!
