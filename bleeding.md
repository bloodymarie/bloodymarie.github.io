Aren't we all celebrating these moments of joy, in the shower, unplugging the menstrual cup and splattering the floor?! Such joy!

So in this section I want to praise and collect projects & stuff that is related to menstruation in some way or another. Many awesome people have thought about menstruation in many different and sometimes playful ways.

## Rupi Kaur

The [artist Rupi Kaur](https://www.rupikaur.com/period/) has created fascinating poetry about periods together with a beautiful series of photography.

## May Ryan & Mona Chalabi

Mae Ryan and Mona Chalabi from the Guardian have created [Vagina Dispatches](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/series/vagina-dispatches) last year. In four episodes they are talking about sex education, anatomy, pleasure and about menstruation, *highly recommended*.

So here I am sharing the second episode of the Vagina Dispatches with you, which is about stopping periods.

>"Some women have chosen to stop their periods â€“ we (Mae and Mona) are two of them. In episode two of Vagina Dispatches, we speak to a doctor who thinks periods are unnatural, a former Olympian, a menstrual blood artist and a formerly incarcerated woman to find out if we should stop having periods."

## Sarah Levy

The artist [Sarah Levy](https://www.sarahlevyart.com/bloodytrump/) paints with menstrual blood. My favourite piece is her portrait of Donald Trump.
